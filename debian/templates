_Description: Do you want to patch mailman for virtual support?
 The AlternC mailman plugin can optionally patch mailman to make it
 support same-name lists on different domains (ie. allow
 test@example.com and test@example.org to coexist). Mailman 2.x, by
 default, doesn't support that functionality but Koumbit.org has
 developped patches to make it.
 .
 The plugin only supports patching, no way to unpatch right
 now. Please understand that this process will modify core Mailman
 code and might break some functionality. It is running in production
 on Koumbit.org.
 .
 Also, note that everytime the mailman package is upgraded or
 reinstalled, the patches will need to be reapplied manually. This can
 be done by reconfiguring the alternc-mailman package.  .
 .
 The patches are in /usr/share/alternc-mailman/patches. More
 information about the patch at
 http://wiki.koumbit.net/VirtualMailman.
