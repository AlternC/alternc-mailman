alternc-mailman (1.6) stable; urgency=low

    This releases finally packages the VirtualMailman patches properly,
    instead of assuming that the admin installed the patches on his
    own. The patches are installed during the installation, after
    confirmation by the user through debconf.
  
    If you already have a patched mailman installation, you should add a
    mark file so that this package knows about it otherwise it's going to
    try and repatch Mailman, which will fail and you will not be able to
    upgrade alternc-mailman. To fix this, do the following:
  
    mkdir -p /usr/share/alternc-mailman/patches
    cd /usr/share/alternc-mailman/patches
    touch mailman-true-virtual-2.1.9.patch
    ln -s mailman-true-virtual-2.1.9.patch mailman-true-virtual.applied
  
    Only then install this package. Those steps are only required for
    installations that are already patched.
