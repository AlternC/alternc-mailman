alternc-mailman (1.8) stable; urgency=low

    This version changes the following : 
    * The blue desktop is alternc's default as for 0.9.10. alternc-mailman 1.8 is using 
      this blue desktop as a default too, and the code in the admin/ folder is now compliant
      with this frameless way of showing the panel pages.
    * Users are now able to change a list password from AlternC (useful when a user forgot his 
      list's password). A new perl binary has been added to call /var/lib/mailman/bin/change_pw 
      accordingly
    * The code has been reworked to include only clean, javadoc-compliant, english written comments

alternc-mailman (1.7) stable; urgency=low

    add a configuration variable to control the domain in the list urls. if it
    is set, it will be used to construct the urls in the mailing list
    listings. If it is unset, the list's domain name will be used.

    the default behaviour is therefore reverted to the one before 1.5 (svn
    [2097]) where the list domain is used (without the prepended "mail.").

    in case the variable is set, the administrator still needs to convert the
    urls of existing lists and fix the default url in mm_cfg.py for new lists.
    this can be done with a script like this in /var/lib/mailman/change_url:

    def change_url(mlist):
        mlist.web_page_url='https://listes.koumbit.net/cgi-bin/mailman/'
        mlist.Save()
        mlist.Unlock()

    ... called like this:

     /usr/lib/mailman/bin/withlist -l -r change_url -a
     
     See https://alternc.org/ticket/1131 for more information.

alternc-mailman (1.6) stable; urgency=low

    This releases finally packages the VirtualMailman patches properly,
    instead of assuming that the admin installed the patches on his
    own. The patches are installed during the installation, after
    confirmation by the user through debconf.
  
    If you already have a patched mailman installation, you should add a
    mark file so that this package knows about it otherwise it's going to
    try and repatch Mailman, which will fail and you will not be able to
    upgrade alternc-mailman. To fix this, do the following:
  
    mkdir -p /usr/share/alternc-mailman/patches
    cd /usr/share/alternc-mailman/patches
    touch mailman-true-virtual-2.1.9.patch
    ln -s mailman-true-virtual-2.1.9.patch mailman-true-virtual.applied
  
    Only then install this package. Those steps are only required for
    installations that are already patched.
